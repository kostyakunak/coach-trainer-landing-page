## 📋 About the Project

Created a modern landing page for an esotericism and parapsychology coach. The site is fully responsive, with beautiful animations and optimized for client conversion.

## 🛠 Technologies I Used

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern library for creating user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Added type safety for code reliability
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server (10x faster than Webpack)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling

### UI Components
- **Radix UI** - Accessible and customizable components (accordions, buttons, dialogs)
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful SVG icons
- **Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions

### Deploy & Infrastructure
- **Netlify** - Automatic deployment from GitHub
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub** - Code hosting

## 🎯 What I Implemented

### Design & UX
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Site looks great on all devices
- ✅ **Modern animations** - Smooth transitions and hover effects
- ✅ **Gradients and visual effects** - Created atmosphere of magic and esotericism
